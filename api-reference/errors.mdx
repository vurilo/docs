Academykit.co API returns machine readable error codes, human readable error messages and a link to the docs for more information.
Here is how an error response looks like:

```json
{
  HTTP Status: 400

    {
    "message": "The requested resource was not found.",
    }
}
```
## Status Codes
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the most frequent status codes returned by the Academykit.co API, along with their explanations and solutions:

### `400: Bad Request`
- **Problem:** The request is malformed, either missing required fields, using wrong datatypes, or being syntactically incorrect.
- **Solution:** Check the request and make sure it is properly formatted.

### `401: Unauthorized`
- **Problem:** The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.
- **Solution:** Make sure you are using the correct API key or access token.

### `403: Forbidden`
- **Problem:** The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it because the client lacks proper permission.
- **Solution:** Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the resource.

### `404: Not Found`
- **Problem:** The server has not found anything matching the request URI.
- **Solution:** Check the request and make sure the resource exists.

### `409: Too Many Requests`
- **Problem:** The API key is calling APIs too frequently.
- **Solution:** Slow down the rate to call APIs with the API key. You can refer to the returned value in `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`, `Retry-After` to determine when you can retry any API requests and adjust your frequency.
  
### `500: Internal Server Error`
- **Problem:** The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
- **Solution:** Try again later. If the problem persists, contact support.
