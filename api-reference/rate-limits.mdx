Academykit API rate limiting is in conformance with the [IETF standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers):

| Header Name           | Description                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| X-RateLimit-Limit     | The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make per hour. |
| X-RateLimit-Remaining | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.              |
| X-RateLimit-Reset     | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds.    |
| Retry-After           | The number of seconds to wait before retrying the request again.                |

Academykit API is capped at 60 requests per minute per key.

Youâ€™ll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response code if the rate limit is exceeded.
