## Base URL

Academykit's API is being built on REST principles and will be served over HTTPS. To ensure data privacy, unencrypted HTTP is not supported.


## Authentication

Authentication to Academykit's API is performed via the Authorization header with a Bearer token. To authenticate, you need to include the Authorization header with the word `Bearer` followed by your API key in your requests like so:

```bash Terminal
Authorization: Bearer <Your-Token>
```

## Response Codes

The API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Here are a few examples:

| Code  | Description                                                                                    |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200` | The request was successful.                                                                    |
| `400` | The request was invalid or cannot be served.                                                   |
| `401` | The request requires user authentication.                                                      |
| `403` | The server understood the request, but refuses to authorize it.                                |
| `404` | The requested resource could not be found.                                                     |
| `429` | Too many requests.                                                                             |
