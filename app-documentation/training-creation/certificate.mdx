**Certificate Generation Setup:**
Ensure participants receive recognition for completing training programs by setting up certificate generation in Academy Kit. Follow these steps to configure the certificate generation process within the training section:

1. **Access Training Settings:**
   - Log in to your Academy Kit account with administrative privileges.
   - Navigate to the training management section from the main menu.

2. **Select Training Program:**
   - Choose the specific training program for which you want to set up certificate generation.

3. **Access Certificate Settings:**
   - Within the training settings, locate the certificate option.

4. **Configure certificate Fields:**
   - Specify which dynamic fields should be populated with relevant information from the training program.
     - Participant's Name (Dynamic)
     - Training Title
     - Start Date
     - End Date
     - Trainer or Administrator's Name and Designation
     - Trainer or Administrator's Signature

5. **Upload Signature:**
   - Upload the digital signature of the authorized person (e.g., trainer, administrator) who will sign the certificates. Ensure the signature file is in the appropriate format (e.g., PNG, JPEG) and meets any size or resolution requirements.

6. **Enable Certificate Generation:**
   - Activate the certificate generation feature to automatically generate certificates for participants upon completion of the training program. Specify whether certificates should be generated for all participants or only those who meet specific completion criteria (e.g., passing grade, attendance threshold).

7. **Test Certificate Generation:**
   - Conduct a test run to ensure that certificates are generated accurately and contain the correct information in the dynamic fields. Verify that certificates are delivered in the desired format (e.g., PDF, digital).

8. **Monitor Certificate Distribution:**
    - Monitor the certificate generation process and distribution within the training management section to ensure that all participants receive their certificates in a timely manner. Address any issues or discrepancies promptly to maintain participant satisfaction and program integrity.

By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate certificate generation into your training programs in Academy Kit, providing participants with tangible recognition of their accomplishments and motivating them to engage actively in the learning process.
