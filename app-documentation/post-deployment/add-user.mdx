## Registering Users in the System

In the Users tab, you can manage all members and edit their details/information.

### Add Users

Add users to your organization by inviting them via email. Users will be added upon acceptance through the registration process.

**Note:** User status and role can be modified at any time (active/inactive, admin/trainer/trainee). Users who have not logged into the application at least once will be in pending status.

**Steps to Add a New User:**
1. Log in to the system.
2. Navigate to the Users option in the sidebar.
3. Click on the "Add User" button.
4. Fill in mandatory fields such as First Name, Last Name, Email, User Role (Admin, Trainer, or Trainee), and Department (select from the predefined departments in the master setup).
5. Click the "Submit" button.

### Import Users Using .CSV File

Import organization members by creating a new CSV file and following the specified format.

**Steps to Import Users:**
1. Create a new CSV sheet with headers: FirstName, MiddleName, LastName, Email, MobileNumber, Role, Department, and Designation.
2. Log in to the system (URL: https://standalone.apps.vurilo.com/login).
3. Navigate to the Users option in the sidebar.
4. Click on the "Add User" button.
5. Choose "Import Users" and select the CSV file.
6. Once imported, users will be added to your organization.

**Note:** If your domain name is "apple.com", a user added will receive an email ID as "ram@apple.com".

### Master Setup

#### Adding Department

1. **Login to the System:**
   - Access the system using your admin credentials. Navigate to the login page using the provided URL.

2. **Access admin settings:**
   - Once logged in, locate and access the Master Setup section. This is typically found in the admin or settings area of the system.

3. **Navigate to Departments:**
   - Within the Master Setup, locate the option for managing departments. This could be labeled as "Departments" or "Organization Structure."

4. **Add New Department:**
   - Look for an option to add a new department and click on it. This action should open a form or dialog box where you can input the details of the new department.

5. **Enter Department Details:**
   - In the form provided, enter the necessary details for the new department. This typically includes the department name, description, and any other relevant information.

6. **Save Changes:**
   - After entering the department details, save your changes. This action may be labeled as "Save," "Add Department," or similar.

7. **Verify Addition:**
   - Once saved, verify that the new department has been successfully added to the master setup. You may need to navigate back to the list of departments to confirm.

8. **Optional: Edit or Delete Departments:**
   - Depending on system permissions, you may have the option to edit or delete departments. Use these options as needed to manage your organization's department structure.

By following these steps, you can add departments to the master setup of your system, enabling you to link them with users during the registration process or for organizational structuring purposes.
