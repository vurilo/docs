**Add Modules and Content:**

Once you've set up the basic details of your training, it's time to add modules and content to enhance the learning experience. Here's a detailed guide on how to structure your modules and select various content elements:

- **Section Structure:**
  - **Organize by Topics or Learning Objectives:** Start by determining the overarching topics or learning objectives that your training program will cover. Break down these topics into smaller, manageable sections, which will serve as your sections.
  - **Logical Sequencing:** Arrange the modules in a logical order that facilitates progressive learning. Consider the flow of information and ensure that each module builds upon the previous one to create a cohesive learning journey.
  - **Consistent Format:** Maintain a consistent format for module titles and descriptions to provide clarity and coherence to participants. Use descriptive titles that accurately reflect the content covered in each module.

- **Content Elements Within Modules:**
  - **Videos:** Incorporate video lectures, demonstrations within each module to provide dynamic visual explanations of key concepts. Use high-quality videos with clear audio and visuals to enhance engagement and understanding.
  - **PDFs:** Supplement your training with  PDF documents containing additional reading materials, reference guides, or worksheets. Ensure that the PDFs are well-formatted and easily accessible to participants.
  - **Exams:** Create quizzes, tests, or assessments within specific modules to evaluate learners' comprehension and retention of the material. Specify the duration of each exam and include negative marking for incorrect answers. The marks will be auto-calculated based on the responses provided by participants. Question to the exams can be pulled from the Question pool.
  - **Assignments:** Assign practical tasks, projects, or case studies within relevant modules that allow participants to apply their knowledge and skills in real-world scenarios. Include both subjective and objective questions in assignments to assess learners' understanding comprehensively.
  - **Live Sessions:** Schedule live event, virtual classrooms, or interactive workshops within designated modules to facilitate real-time interaction and collaboration among participants.
  - **Surveys and Feedback:** Include surveys or feedback forms within modules to gather participants' input and assess their understanding and satisfaction with the content. Use this feedback to continuously improve and tailor future training programs to meet learners' needs and expectations.

- **Lesson Completion Requirements:**
  - **Progressive Learning:** Set up the system to require learners to complete content within modules before moving on to the next one. This ensures that participants fully engage with the content and master the material at their own pace.


By incorporating these features into your training modules, you can create a comprehensive and interactive learning experience that maximizes participant engagement and knowledge retention.
