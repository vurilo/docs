### Certificate Generation Setup Guide

Ensure participants receive recognition for completing training programs by configuring certificate generation in academykit. Follow these steps to set up the certificate generation process within the training section:

1. **Access Training Settings:**
   - Log in to your academykit account with administrative privileges.
   - Navigate to the training section from the main menu.

2. **Select Training Program:**
   - Choose the specific training program for which you want to set up certificate generation.

3. **Access Certificate Settings:**
   - Within the training settings, locate the certificate option.

4. **Configure Certificate Fields:**
   - Specify the data to be included in the certificate, such as:
     - Participant's Name (Dynamic)
     - Training Title
     - Start Date
     - End Date
     - Trainer or Administrator's Name and Designation (Up to three allowed)
     - Trainer or Administrator's Signature (Up to three signatures allowed)

5. **Upload Signature:**
   - Upload the digital signature of the authorized person (e.g., trainer, administrator) who will sign the certificates. Ensure the signature file is in the appropriate format (e.g., PNG, JPEG) and meets any size or resolution requirements.

6. **Preview Certificate Generation:**
   - Before issuing certificates to participants, preview the generated certificates to ensure accuracy and completeness.

7. **Certificate Issuance:**
   - After verifying the preview, issue the certificates to individual participants.

8. **Download Option for Participants:** 
   - Enable participants to download their certificates in PDF or image format directly from their user profile. Include a download button or link next to each certificate for easy access.

9. **External Certificate Verification:** 
   - A verification process for external certificates to verify the authenticity of issued certificates. Utilize a verification system where certificates can be validated by administrators or super-administrators.

By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate certificate generation into your training programs in academykit, providing participants with tangible recognition of their accomplishments and motivating them to engage actively in the learning process.
