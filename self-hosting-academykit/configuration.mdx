## SMTP Configuration

Setting up SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) configuration is necessary for enabling email communication functionalities within the application. Configure SMTP settings by providing sender email addresses, reply email addresses, SMTP server details, authentication credentials, and port numbers to facilitate the sending and receiving of emails.
<Note>
  Ensure SMTP configuration is completed before adding the user, as
  failure to do so will result in email containing password not being sent.
</Note>

## File Storage Configuration

Users must set up file storage configuration to enable seamless storage and access to files within the application. This involves providing details such as server access keys, bucket names, server URLs, and authentication credentials to establish a connection with the designated file storage system.
