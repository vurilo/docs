## SMTP Configuration

Configure SMTP settings by providing sender email addresses, reply email addresses, SMTP server details, authentication credentials, and port numbers to facilitate the sending and receiving of emails.
<Note>
  Ensure SMTP configuration is completed before adding the user, as
  failure to do so will result in email containing password not being sent.
</Note>

## File Storage Configuration
