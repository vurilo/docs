This quickstart guide will help you get started with deploying your application on a Linux server using Docker. Follow these steps to quickly set up and run your application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed and configured on your system:

- Ubuntu 20.04 (server)
- Docker installed on your system.
- Permissions on the server with sudo access



1. **Pull Docker Image:**
   Pull the Docker image from Docker Hub using the following command:
   ```
   sudo docker pull vurilo/tmis:latest
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
  Configure the necessary environment variables as shown [here](essentials/env).

3. **Start Docker Container:**
   Run the following command to start the Docker container with your application:
   ```
   sudo docker run -d --name tmis_container -p 80:80 vurilo/tmis:latest
   ```
   Replace `tmis_container` with a name for your container.
   
4. **Verify Deployment:**
   Once the container is up and running, open a web browser and navigate to your server's IP address or domain name. You should see your application up and running.

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed your application on a Linux server using Docker. You can now start using and testing your application.
