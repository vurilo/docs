### Prerequisites
Before deploying Vurilo TMIS, ensure your server meets the following minimum requirements:
- **Application Server:**
  - **OS:** Linux
  - **RAM:** 8 GB
  - **CPU:** 2 Cores (4 Cores recommended)
  - **Hard Drive:** 100 GB
- **Database Server:**
  - **OS:** Linux
  - **RAM:** 4 GB (8 GB recommended)
  - **CPU:** 2 Cores (4 Cores recommended)
  - **Hard Drive:** 100 GB (Increase as per storage needs)
- **Video Server:**
  - **OS:** Linux
  - **RAM:** 8 GB
  - **CPU:** 4 Cores
  - **Hard Drive:** 100 GB (Increase as per storage needs)

Additionally, you'll need to install Minio for object storage. Instructions for installing Minio are provided below.

### Step 1: Install Docker on Linux Machine (If not installed)

```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install docker.io
    sudo systemctl start docker
    sudo systemctl enable docker
    docker --version
    sudo docker run hello-world
```
### Step 2: Install MySQL (If not installed)

```bash
    sudo apt install mysql-server
    sudo mysql_secure_installation
    sudo systemctl start mysql
    sudo systemctl enable mysql
    mysql -u root
```

### Step 3:Database Configuration:
Once MySQL is installed, configure the database for the application by executing the following SQL commands:

```bash
    CREATE DATABASE TMIS;
    CREATE USER 'TMIS'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TMIS.* TO 'TMIS'@'%';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### Step 4: Setup and Configuration of Application Server
Follow these steps to set up and configure the application server using Docker:

1. Obtain SSL certificates and private keys from the client and place them in the appropriate directories within the application.
2. Create a docker-compose.yml file in the application root directory.
3. Inside the nginx folder, create a Dockerfile with appropriate content.
4. Update docker-compose.yml with environment variables and configuration.
5. Build and run Docker containers:
```bash
    sudo docker-compose build
    sudo docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 5: Deploy SSL Certificates
To deploy SSL certificates, create a docker-compose-certificate.yml file with appropriate environment variables. Then, execute the following commands:
``` bash
    sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose-certificate.yml build
    sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose-certificate.yml up -d
```

### Step 2: Configure Minio
1. Once Minio is installed, you need to set up buckets and access policies.
2. Ensure Minio is running and accessible from your application server.

### Step 3: Deploy Vurilo TMIS
Follow the deployment steps provided in the previous section to pull the Vurilo TMIS Docker image and run the container.

### Step 4: Access Vurilo TMIS
After deploying Vurilo TMIS, access it via a web browser using the appropriate URL.

### Step 5: Initial Setup
Complete the initial setup process within Vurilo TMIS to configure system settings, create admin accounts, and set up your organization's details.

### Step 6: Start Exploring
Congratulations! You've successfully deployed Vurilo TMIS with Minio for object storage. Start exploring the features and functionalities to create, manage, and deliver engaging learning experiences.

### Additional Resources
- For advanced configurations and customization options, refer to the [Vurilo TMIS documentation](#) (link to documentation).
- Join the Vurilo community on [GitHub](https://github.com/vurilo) to stay updated, report issues, and contribute to the project.
### Prerequisites
Before deploying Vurilo TMIS, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Docker installed on your system. You can download and install Docker from [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/vurilo/tmis).

### Edit and preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with
    your docs content. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview changes">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally. 1. Install the
    [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    documentation changes locally with this command: ``` npm i -g mintlify ```
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
    `mint.json` is): ``` mintlify dev ```
  </Accordion>

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
